# Spark SQL Adaptive Execution
There are three main features in Adaptive Execution, including auto setting the shuffle partition number, optimizing join strategy at runtime and handling skewed join. These features can be enabled separately. To start with Adaptive Exection on Spark 2.3, please build branch `ae-2.3-08` and at least set `spark.sql.adaptive.enabled` to true. For users who enabled external shuffle service, please also upgrade external shuffle service to use adaptive execution feature.
An Engilish version design doc is available on [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mpVjvQZRAkD-Ggy6
## Auto Setting The Shuffle Partition Number
<table class="table">
<tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Default</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.sql.adaptive.enabled</code></td>
  <td>false</td>
  <td>
    When true, enable adaptive query execution.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.sql.adaptive.minNumPostShufflePartitions</code></td>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>
    The minimum number of post-shuffle partitions used in adaptive execution. This can be used to control the mi
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.sql.adaptive.maxNumPostShufflePartitions</code></td>
  <td>500</td>
  <td>
    The maximum number of post-shuffle partitions used in adaptive execution. This is also used as the initial s
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.targetPostShuffleInputSize</code></td>
  <td>67108864</td>
  <td>
    The target post-shuffle input size in bytes of a task. By default is 64 MB.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.targetPostShuffleRowCount</code></td>
  <td>20000000</td>
  <td>
    The target post-shuffle row count of a task. This only takes effect if row count information is collected.

## Optimizing Join Strategy at Runtime
<table class="table">

  <td><code>spark.sql.adaptive.join.enabled</code></td>
  <td>true</td>
  <td>
    When true and <code>spark.sql.adaptive.enabled</code> is enabled, a better join strategy is determined at ru
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.sql.adaptiveBroadcastJoinThreshold</code></td>
  <td>equals to <code>spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold</code></td>
  <td>
    Configures the maximum size in bytes for a table that will be broadcast to all worker nodes when performing

</tr>

## Handling Skewed Join
<table class="table">
<tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Default</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.sql.adaptive.skewedJoin.enabled</code></td>
  <td>false</td>
  <td>
    When true and <code>spark.sql.adaptive.enabled</code> is enabled, a skewed join is automatically handled at 
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.sql.adaptive.skewedPartitionFactor</code></td>
  <td>10</code></td>
  <td>
    A partition is considered as a skewed partition if its size is larger than this factor multiple the median p
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.sql.adaptive.skewedPartitionSizeThreshold</code></td>
  <td>67108864</td>
  <td>
    Configures the minimum size in bytes for a partition that is considered as a skewed partition in adaptive sk
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.sql.adaptive.skewedPartitionRowCountThreshold</code></td>
  <td>10000000</td>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.shuffle.statistics.verbose</code></td>
  <td>false</td>
  <td>
    Collect shuffle statistics in verbose mode, including row counts etc. This is required for handling skewed j
